Basic page structue is created with html, and logo, font, or size are developed with css. In CSS, I used SASS file with modules to push everything to main.css file easily. Also, AJAX is used for better quality of development. There are three pages which are home, design, and contact you can code, and blog page is connected to real blog site(new link).
